08.59\xa0EST\nThe Washington Post is now supporting CNN’s report that the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as early as next week.\nRegulations call for Mueller to submit to the attorney general a confidential explanation as to why he decided to charge certain individuals, as well as who else he investigated and why he decided not to charge those people.\nThe regulations then call for the attorney general to report to Congress about the investigation.\nAn adviser to President Trump said there is palpable concern among the president’s inner circle that the report might contain information about Trump and his team that is politically damaging, but not criminal conduct.\nAfter postponing due to threats against his family, Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, has set a date to appear before Congress.\nNEW: the House Oversight Committee just announced former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will appear for a public hearing on Wednesday, Feb 27.\nThe Guardian’s Jon Swaine reports that a neo-Nazi serving as a lieutenant in the US coast guard was allegedly plotting an attack on Democratic members of Congress and media personalities.\nhttps://t.co/hBvNR58w2Z Christopher Hasson intended “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,” according to a filing to federal court in Maryland.\nFor those keeping score at home: Monday's lawsuit was the 46th lawsuit California has filed against the Trump administration https://t.co/cx2zDFSCMO Read more about the Trump v.\nHassan Shibly, the lawyer for the family of Hoda Muthana, shared a document on Twitter that appears to show the young woman was born in New Jersey in 1994.\nShibly has told reporters that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father, who was a diplomat.\n“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly told The Associated Press.\nMuthana was born in the United States to parents from Yemen who became naturalized American citizens, according to the Counter Extremism Project at George Washington University.\nBREAKING: Muthana family provides birth certificate of Hoda Muthana born in Hackensack New Jersey in October 1994, months after her father informed the US Government he was no longer a diplomat.\nThis is significant because the women of the Senate, some of Sanders’ fiercest competition for the nomination, were ahead in the first three straw polls, which in one survey found Sanders behind vice president Joe Biden, the closest the field may have to an establishment backed moderate.\nIn the 24-hour poll, which coincided with Sanders’ launch, his standing rose from 13% in two weeks ago to 44%, while Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren round out the top three with 15% and 10% respectively, according to the survey results.In as much as any poll can reveal at this point, it’s another sign that Sanders has maintained significant grassroots support.\nHouse Democrats plan to file a resolution as soon as Friday that’s aimed at blocking President Donald Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press.\nDonald Trump said on Twitter that he ordered the State department to block Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who left the US to join Islamic State in 2014, from returning to the US.\nMuthana told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group and wants to return to the US with her 18-month-old son.\nEarlier today, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Muthana was “not a citizen,” but the State department has not responded to inquiries from the Guardian about how that could be the case for the 24-year-old, who was born in New Jersey.\nI have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\nTrump’s tweet raises questions about the State department’s declaration that Muthana is “not a citizen” and whether that designation is in accordance with US and international law.\nThe Trump adminstration’s statements about Muthana also contrast their calls on other countries to bring back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals.\nA new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) says that hate groups in the US have continued to surge in the Trump era, and that the president himself has helped to mainstream hate by “fueling fears of a white minority country”.\nJason Wilson, writing for the Guardian, said the SPLC counted 1,020 hate groups in the United States in 2018, up 7% from the previous year: In a press conference, Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project blamed in part the “words and imagery coming out of the Trump administration” which have been “heightening the fears” of demographic replacement.\nThe report points to a range of murders and violent attacks – like a mail-bombing spree that targeted Democrats and media organisations and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue – as evidence that the conspiracy-fueled far right is increasingly willing to commit extreme acts.\nAnother similar recent report from the Anti-Defamation League suggested that extremist murders in the United States in 2018 were carried out almost exclusively by the far right.\nBut the SPLC also points to the increasingly strident expression of far right ideas in conservative media, and from Republican politicians, as evidence that hate is being mainstreamed.\nLawyers for the family of Hoda Muthana – the American-born woman who told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria – have responded to secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s claim that the 24-year-old is not a US citizen.\nAn attorney for the woman’s family, Hassan Shibly, told the Associated Press that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father.\n“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly said.\nMuthana was born in 1994 in Hackensack, New Jersey, the lawyer said.\nMost people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship but there are exceptions.\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to US law and is not automatically considered a US citizen at birth.\nA former Trump campaign staffer has filed a class action lawsuit seeking to invalidate all nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements signed by staffers to the campaign, according to Buzzfeed’s Zoe Tilllman: The claims brought by former campaign staffer Jessica Denson represent the broadest attack to date on the Trump campaign’s practice of having staffers, volunteers, and contractors sign agreements barring them from ever publicly criticizing Trump, his company, or his family, and from disclosing private or confidential information.\nDonald Trump said the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation would be “totally up to the attorney general” while taking questions from reporters at the White House this afternoon.\nPresident Trump: The decision whether to release the Mueller report will be totally up to the Attorney General.\npic.twitter.com/4GCuAALqQa Trump also insulted Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, who has been criticizing

Guardian'}, 'severity': {'S': '7'}, 'summary': {'S': "President orders state department to deny return of American-born woman, Hoda Muthana, who joined Islamic State in 2015 \nFirst published on Wed 20 Feb 2019 08.59\xa0EST\nThe Washington Post is now supporting CNN’s report that the attorney general, William Barr, could announce the completion of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation as early as next week.\nRegulations call for Mueller to submit to the attorney general a confidential explanation as to why he decided to charge certain individuals, as well as who else he investigated and why he decided not to charge those people.\nThe regulations then call for the attorney general to report to Congress about the investigation.\nAn adviser to President Trump said there is palpable concern among the president’s inner circle that the report might contain information about Trump and his team that is politically damaging, but not criminal conduct.\nAfter postponing due to threats against his family, Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, has set a date to appear before Congress.\nNEW: the House Oversight Committee just announced former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen will appear for a public hearing on Wednesday, Feb 27.\nThe Guardian’s Jon Swaine reports that a neo-Nazi serving as a lieutenant in the US coast guard was allegedly plotting an attack on Democratic members of Congress and media personalities.\nhttps://t.co/hBvNR58w2Z Christopher Hasson intended “to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,” according to a filing to federal court in Maryland.\nFor those keeping score at home: Monday's lawsuit was the 46th lawsuit California has filed against the Trump administration https://t.co/cx2zDFSCMO Read more about the Trump v.\nHassan Shibly, the lawyer for the family of Hoda Muthana, shared a document on Twitter that appears to show the young woman was born in New Jersey in 1994.\nShibly has told reporters that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father, who was a diplomat.\n“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly told The Associated Press.\nMuthana was born in the United States to parents from Yemen who became naturalized American citizens, according to the Counter Extremism Project at George Washington University.\nBREAKING: Muthana family provides birth certificate of Hoda Muthana born in Hackensack New Jersey in October 1994, months after her father informed the US Government he was no longer a diplomat.\nThis is significant because the women of the Senate, some of Sanders’ fiercest competition for the nomination, were ahead in the first three straw polls, which in one survey found Sanders behind vice president Joe Biden, the closest the field may have to an establishment backed moderate.\nIn the 24-hour poll, which coincided with Sanders’ launch, his standing rose from 13% in two weeks ago to 44%, while Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren round out the top three with 15% and 10% respectively, according to the survey results.In as much as any poll can reveal at this point, it’s another sign that Sanders has maintained significant grassroots support.\nHouse Democrats plan to file a resolution as soon as Friday that’s aimed at blocking President Donald Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the Southwest border, according to the Associated Press.\nDonald Trump said on Twitter that he ordered the State department to block Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who left the US to join Islamic State in 2014, from returning to the US.\nMuthana told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group and wants to return to the US with her 18-month-old son.\nEarlier today, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said Muthana was “not a citizen,” but the State department has not responded to inquiries from the Guardian about how that could be the case for the 24-year-old, who was born in New Jersey.\nI have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and he fully agrees, not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!\nTrump’s tweet raises questions about the State department’s declaration that Muthana is “not a citizen” and whether that designation is in accordance with US and international law.\nThe Trump adminstration’s statements about Muthana also contrast their calls on other countries to bring back and prosecute their own jihadist nationals.\nA new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) says that hate groups in the US have continued to surge in the Trump era, and that the president himself has helped to mainstream hate by “fueling fears of a white minority country”.\nJason Wilson, writing for the Guardian, said the SPLC counted 1,020 hate groups in the United States in 2018, up 7% from the previous year: In a press conference, Heidi Beirich, the director of the SPLC’s Intelligence Project blamed in part the “words and imagery coming out of the Trump administration” which have been “heightening the fears” of demographic replacement.\nThe report points to a range of murders and violent attacks – like a mail-bombing spree that targeted Democrats and media organisations and a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue – as evidence that the conspiracy-fueled far right is increasingly willing to commit extreme acts.\nAnother similar recent report from the Anti-Defamation League suggested that extremist murders in the United States in 2018 were carried out almost exclusively by the far right.\nBut the SPLC also points to the increasingly strident expression of far right ideas in conservative media, and from Republican politicians, as evidence that hate is being mainstreamed.\nLawyers for the family of Hoda Muthana – the American-born woman who told the Guardian this week that she regretted leaving the US to join the terrorist group Islamic State in Syria – have responded to secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s claim that the 24-year-old is not a US citizen.\nAn attorney for the woman’s family, Hassan Shibly, told the Associated Press that the administration’s position is based on a “complicated” interpretation of the law involving her father.\n“They’re claiming her dad was a diplomat when she was born, which, in fact, he wasn’t,” Shibly said.\nMuthana was born in 1994 in Hackensack, New Jersey, the lawyer said.\nMost people born in the United States are accorded so-called birthright citizenship but there are exceptions.\nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act, a person born in the U.S. to a foreign diplomatic officer is not subject to US law and is not automatically considered a US citizen at birth.\nA former Trump campaign staffer has filed a class action lawsuit seeking to invalidate all nondisclosure and non-disparagement agreements signed by staffers to the campaign, according to Buzzfeed’s Zoe Tilllman: The claims brought by former campaign staffer Jessica Denson represent the broadest attack to date on the Trump campaign’s practice of having staffers, volunteers, and contractors sign agreements barring them from ever publicly criticizing Trump, his company, or his family, and from disclosing private or confidential information.\nDonald Trump said the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation would be “totally up to the attorney general” while taking questions from reporters at the White House this afternoon.\nPresident Trump: The decision whether to release the Mueller report will be totally up to the Attorney General.\npic.twitter.com/4GCuAALqQa Trump also insulted Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, who has been criticizing
