1) After installation nginx
2) go to nginx.conf and give the index.html file location in ec2
3)previously it worked on port 9021

Way I instlled on my linux

1) Install nginx
2) create a NAT gateway in VPC for subnet and map to the ec2 instance
3) sudo service nginx start ---> will lead to seeing the nginx base page on public ip in internet
4) go to etc/nginx/nginx.conf to update the root for where the code is
5) restart nginx and it will launch the application
